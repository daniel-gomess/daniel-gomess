Hello, my name is Daniel (@daniel-gomess). I am interested in exchanging experiences and networks. I'm studying javascript, css and html, and whenever possible I try to learn a little python and data science too. I have some experience with sqlserver.
You can find me through my LinkedIn profile(https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-gomes-13565677/)
